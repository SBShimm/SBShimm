Building enterprise systems where business operations and software meet.

## 🚀 About Me

I build enterprise systems in data-intensive operational environments.

I began my career at a software vendor delivering **Yard Planning** and **Ship Planning** systems to container terminal operators.
Working on a core product platform, I implemented customized features based on project requirements and operational differences across terminals.

Through this experience, I developed a strong understanding of logistics workflows, scheduling logic, and high-volume database systems.

Currently, I manage and evolve an in-house ERP system at a green coffee bean import company,
supporting trade, production, sales, and logistics processes end to end.

I enjoy translating complex business requirements into structured, reliable systems —
balancing technical depth with real-world operational needs.

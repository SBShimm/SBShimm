## About Me

I specialize in ERP and logistics systems within data-intensive enterprise environments.

Previously, I worked at a software vendor delivering Yard Planning and Ship Planning systems to container terminal operators.
Based on a core product platform, I implemented customized options according to gap analysis results and operational requirements defined by project managers.

Currently, I manage and evolve an in-house ERP system at a green coffee bean import company, supporting trade, production, sales, and logistics workflows.

My work focuses on:

- Designing scalable and maintainable ERP architectures
- Implementing business requirements into structured system logic
- Managing multi-database environments (MSSQL / Oracle)
- Improving long-term system stability in live operational systems
